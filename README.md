# 📑 Textspace

I have created an application using React named "Textspace". This application can convert original text to uppercase and lowercase, copy to a clipboard, remove extra space in between the words and also clear out the given text. It also provides a preview of the text. It also calculates the number of words and characters and how much time it will take to read the given text.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Used 

**Tool(s):** VS Code, npm

**Programming Language(s):** React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML
